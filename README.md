Title: The WellesleyWorld, a better WellesleyHive.

Status: Beta Version

Project Overview: Our goal is to implement a site that's a little more informal than WellesleyHive, which allows you to meet with Wellesley students and alumni in your area for coffee chats or informal gatherings. WellesleyWorld is a site dedicated to meeting other people who have Wellesley as a common experience. We hope to make it easier to make connections with and among alums. Our framework will mainly be from WellesleyHive with inspiration from Facebook. 

New Features:
